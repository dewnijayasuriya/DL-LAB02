1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

More hidden nodes = more capacity for the neural network.
Each hidden node learns a different feature or pattern.

**With a small number of hidden nodes (e.g., 1–2): The model is too simple. Can’t capture complex patterns → underfitting → low accuracy.

**With a large number of hidden nodes (e.g., 20–50): The model can learn more complex and flexible decision boundaries. Accuracy improves because it can better separate the data.

**But if the hidden layer is too large: Model may memorize the training data (overfitting). Accuracy on training data is high, but performance on new/unseen data may drop.


2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?

Usually, the pattern looks like this:

**Very few nodes (1–2):
Accuracy is low (model too simple, underfits).

**Moderate number of nodes (3–10):
Accuracy improves steadily. Model starts fitting data better.

**Larger number of nodes (20–50):
Accuracy becomes very high on training data.
Decision boundary becomes more complex and precise.

**Extremely large number (hundreds or more):
Training accuracy may be 100%, but test accuracy can drop (overfitting).
